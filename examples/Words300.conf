# The best depth-parameter is difficult to estimate
# low depth: runs slower (timeout can take effect), smaller coverage (might be because of timeout),
#  smaller size, linearization is faster
# A high depth will not increase coverage because we start
# out with sufficiently deep partial trees so we get good coverage also at lower depths.
#
# Some reference results specific to a specific version of ACE-in-GF.
# Note that the coverage on partial trees is 82.

# 3: 23/71 -> 17/74
# 4: 28/77
# 5: 36/77
# 6: 43/79
# 7: 51/79 (linearization took forever)
